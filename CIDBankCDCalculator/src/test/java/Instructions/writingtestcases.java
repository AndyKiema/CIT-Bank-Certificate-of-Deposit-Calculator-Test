		/*Writing test scenarios and cases for Selenium functional test cases involves a structured approach to ensure clarity and coverage of the application being tested. Here's a detailed guide to writing test scenarios and test cases for the Certificate of Deposit Calculator page, as mentioned earlier:

		1. Understand the Requirements
		Before writing test cases, gather all the requirements for the functionality you are testing. For the Certificate of Deposit Calculator, the requirements might include:

		Fields for input like deposit amount, term, interest rate, etc.
		Correct calculations for maturity value.
		Error handling for invalid inputs.
		2. Structure of Test Scenarios and Cases
		Test Scenario
		A high-level description of what you want to test. It focuses on what you are testing.

		Test Case
		A detailed step-by-step instruction on how to test. It includes:

		Pre-conditions
		Test steps
		Expected result
		Actual result (added during test execution)
		3. Example Test Scenarios and Test Cases
		Test Scenario 1: Verify the calculator functionality for valid input values.
		Test Case 1.1

		Title: Verify the calculation with valid inputs.
		Pre-condition: The calculator page is loaded, and all input fields are visible.
		Steps:
		Enter $10,000 in the "Deposit Amount" field.
		Select 12 months for the "Term".
		Enter 5% in the "Interest Rate" field.
		Click the "Calculate" button.
		Expected Result:
		The maturity value is calculated and displayed correctly based on the inputs.
		Test Scenario 2: Validate error messages for invalid input.
		Test Case 2.1

		Title: Verify error message for empty fields.
		Pre-condition: The calculator page is loaded.
		Steps:
		Leave all input fields blank.
		Click the "Calculate" button.
		Expected Result:
		An error message like "All fields are required" is displayed.
		Test Case 2.2

		Title: Verify error message for invalid deposit amount.
		Pre-condition: The calculator page is loaded.
		Steps:
		Enter abc in the "Deposit Amount" field.
		Fill other fields with valid inputs.
		Click the "Calculate" button.
		Expected Result:
		An error message like "Invalid deposit amount" is displayed.
		Test Scenario 3: Verify boundary value cases for input fields.
		Test Case 3.1

		Title: Verify calculation with the minimum valid deposit amount.
		Pre-condition: The calculator page is loaded.
		Steps:
		Enter $1 in the "Deposit Amount" field.
		Fill other fields with valid inputs.
		Click the "Calculate" button.
		Expected Result:
		The maturity value is calculated and displayed correctly.
		Test Case 3.2

		Title: Verify behavior for deposit amount exceeding the maximum limit.
		Pre-condition: The calculator page is loaded.
		Steps:
		Enter $10,000,000 in the "Deposit Amount" field.
		Fill other fields with valid inputs.
		Click the "Calculate" button.
		Expected Result:
		An error message like "Deposit amount exceeds the maximum limit" is displayed.
		Test Scenario 4: Verify input field behavior.
		Test Case 4.1

		Title: Verify that only numeric values are allowed in the "Deposit Amount" field.
		Pre-condition: The calculator page is loaded.
		Steps:
		Try entering letters or special characters in the "Deposit Amount" field.
		Expected Result:
		The field does not accept non-numeric input.
		Test Case 4.2

		Title: Verify default values in the calculator fields.
		Pre-condition: The calculator page is loaded.
		Steps:
		Open the page and observe the default values in all fields.
		Expected Result:
		Fields should be empty or display valid defaults.
		4. Additional Considerations
		Edge Cases:

		Verify behavior with 0 deposit amount.
		Verify for extremely large interest rates or terms.
		Cross-Browser Testing:

		Test the functionality on different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
		Responsive Design:

		Check the calculator's functionality on mobile devices.
		5. Test Execution
		Use Selenium to automate these test cases.
		Create test scripts for each test case, ensuring proper validation of expected results.
		Integrate with TestNG or JUnit for reporting if necessary.*/
