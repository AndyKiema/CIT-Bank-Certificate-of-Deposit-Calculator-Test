		/*Writing test scenarios and cases for Selenium functional test cases involves a structured approach to ensure clarity and coverage of the application being tested. Here's a detailed guide to writing test scenarios and test cases for the Certificate of Deposit Calculator page, as mentioned earlier:

		1. Understand the Requirements
		Before writing test cases, gather all the requirements for the functionality you are testing. For the Certificate of Deposit Calculator, the requirements might include:

		Fields for input like deposit amount, term, interest rate, etc.
		Correct calculations for maturity value.
		Error handling for invalid inputs.
		
		NOTES
		Verify input fields	- if they only accept numerical values. Will i get an error message if i dont input numerical values? Will I get an error message if I leave them empty?									
        Verify Cerificate of deposit amount	- come up with table of data								
        During the edge test case step, first get the cd value before inputing zero. Then compare it with the value you will get after inputing zero */
